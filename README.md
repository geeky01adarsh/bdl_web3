# bdl_web3

Current frontend status:
- some bugs on production, probably we have to sync dev version of db with this one which is deployed
- not working otp beacuse we have blocked mailgun account ( lacking privacy policy )
- not installed tailwind, we should follow this https://frontendshape.com/post/how-to-install-tailwind-css-3-in-nuxt-3
- i recomend local development so everyone that will write code should clone our repo https://github.com/gustawdaniel/bdl_web3 and type `make up` in front_nuxt and api_strapi
